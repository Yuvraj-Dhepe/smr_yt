Todo eso es una estafa donde se pierde más que se gana. Blanqueamiento total. Vergonzoso.', 'Lo que se pretende en este anuncio es engañoso: Yo vivo en un pueblecito y la mayoría de vecinos tenemos placas solares de autoconsumo (es decir, no estamos en contra de las renovables). Sin embargo, alrededor del pueblo nos han puesto un mar de cristal donde antes había hectareas de pradera y animales pastando, todo lleno de placas solares que han destrozado el paisaje, el turismo (quien va a querer hacer una ruta entre esos armatostes), la ganadería y la agricultura (multiplicando los precios por hectarea exponencialmente). Desde las grandes ciudades se vera todo muy bonito, pero aqui nos han destrozado el término municipal y lo peor de todo, de manera subvencionada (porque son poco rentables, no nos engañemos). Es decir, nos han hecho pagar con impuestos nuestra propia destrucción como zona rural. El hecho de que tengais que hacer anuncios asi es ya una prueba de peso de que no es algo tan bueno como lo pintais. Solo la mentira necesita subvenciones para imponerse.', 'Publicidad engañosa TOTAL. Argumentos que me dan asco: ""más dinero para turismo"", claro, desmontando paisajes milenarios para contemplar placas de macro proyectos; ""si hay más personas que deciden quedarse en el pueblo"" Eso decís...

En cuanto a ""controles para proteger a la biodiversidad"" me río en vuestra cara, la administración corrupta os dan licencias o costa de prebendas posteriores y así instaláis en zonas protegidas si hace falta. El vídeo os lo podíais haber ahorrado. Hay que tener poca vergüenza.', 'Como instalar un aerogenerador sin una grua 💚🏖👍🏿🌞🌹💋📗⛈️⛵️', 'Menudo greenwashing. Os invito a que leáis Evaluaciones de Impacto ambiental para que os riais un rato. Estudios de fauna y flora sin completar el ciclo anual o planes de restauración de una carilla literal. No se están respetando Espacios Naturales Protegidos, ni Red Natura 2000, ni Habitats de Interés Comunitario, etc, dado que se están haciendo parques en limites con estos espacios (como si los animales entendiesen de fronteras administrativas) e incluso se están aventurando a hacer dentro de RN2000 (leed sobre el cluster del Mestrazgo). Y todo esto en EIAs aprobadas por la administración. Me rio yo del ""fuerte control"". Y para que hablen de respeto a las gentes del lugar, he llegado a leer en una EIA que no importa el impacto acústico en x pueblo porque ""solo viven 100 habitantes"". Se están poniendo molinos a 1 km de casas y otra vez, os invito a ir de noche a 1 km de un parque, a ver si no es como vivir con el ruido de una ciudad de fondo. Respecto al riesgo de desertificación, abrir km de pistas en montes donde había antes vegetación protectora del suelo, mover tierra para crear taludes y bermas para no revegetarlas posteriormente o dejar campos de placas yermos, seguro que contribuye a incrementar la erosión, perder el horizonte A del suelo y posteriormente formar regueros y cárcavas derivando en badlands. \nEsta situación se esta respaldando desde las administraciones, que en algunas CCAA ya están llevadas a fiscalía por múltiples ilegalidades. También, se esta vulnerando el derecho de Aarhus al limitar la participación publica en todo el proceso como sucedió con el Real Decreto-ley 20/2022, de 27 de diciembre.\nSeguro que destruir paisajes naturales y culturales y acelerar la sexta extinción, además de crear malestar a la gente pobladora del medio rural, no es la solución a tomar. Me gustaría que porfavor, me facilitaran un estudio independiente, es decir, sin que lo hayan encargado las propias empresas, que respalde todas las afirmaciones sobre fijación de la población. Yo ya he visto unos cuantos que dicen lo contrario.\nDesde luego la transición energética que nos ofrecen no es una adaptación al cambio climático sino un engrosamiento de bolsillos y como mínimo, un insulto al medio rural. Recordar que las empresas que están llevando a cabo esta monstruosidad son fondos de inversión, clústeres de empresas que se dedican por ejemplo a las macrogranjas de porcino (en mi CCAA) y a cualquier cosa que les venga bien aunque sea poco ecológica, empresas petroleras como BP, Cepsa o Repsol o las tan fiables y amadas empresas energéticas de España como Acciona, Naturgy o Enel.\nTodo esto lo he visto con mis propios ojos, lo que podéis hacer vosotras es verlo vosotras mismas, porque esta pasando seguramente muy cerquita de donde vivís (o igual es mi percepción porque mi comunidad autónoma las están plagando). \n\n\nLa alternativa viene desde lo local, con las comunidades energéticas, autoconsumo o producción distribuida. Pero sin un cambio estructural del uso de los recursos, todo esto no sirve para nada. Creo que usar los mismos métodos que nos han llevado a la crisis ecosocial que enfrentamos hoy día no es una forma adecuada para adaptarnos al cambio climático.\nEs un resumen muy a grosso modo.

Los defensores de ambas opiniones concuerdan en identificar al “dragón”, la “bestia” y el “falso profeta”, con el espiritismo moderno (CS 645) o paganismo, el papado, y el protestantismo apóstata (cf. Ap 13:4; Ap 13:14-15; Ap 19:20; Ap 20:10), respectivamente. Los “tres espíritus inmundos” evidentemente simbolizan o representan a este trío maléfico de poderes religiosos, que juntos constituyen la “gran Babilonia” de los últimos días (Ap 16:13-14; Ap 16:18-19; ver com. Ap 16:19; Ap 17:5). A manera de ranas. Tal vez no deba atribuirse ningún significado a esta comparación, que quizá sólo tiene el propósito de destacar lo repulsivo que son los “tres espíritus  inmundos” delante de Dios...', 'La gente quedó del todo engañada. Se le enseñó que el papa y los sacerdotes eran los representantes de Cristo, cuando en verdad lo eran de Satanás, y a Satanás adoraban cuantos ante ellos se postraban.COP 27 LA MARCA DE LA BESTIA CATECISMO LAUDATO SI CAMBIO CLIMATICO LA MISA DOMINGO SANTIFICAR LAS FIESTAS APOC13:18,19,14:8,11CAP17,19:20,21 .\n\nApocalipsis (de Juan) 13-> Ver.\xa04\xa0Y se postraron ante el Dragón, porque había dado el poderío a la Bestia , y se postraron ante la Bestia diciendo: «¿Quién como la Bestia? ¿Y quién puede luchar contra ella?\n\nApocalipsis (de Juan) 13\n\n[V.2-> Leopardo... oso... león. Una evidente alusión al simbolismo de Dan. 7. Daniel vio tres bestias: la primera era semejante a un león; la segunda, a un oso; la tercera, a un leopardo. La bestia que vio Juan tenía características físicas tomadas de las tres, lo que indica, sin duda alguna, que el poder representado por la bestia de Apocalipsis posee características evidentes en los imperios de Babilonia, Persia y Grecia. Algunos han notado que Juan alude a estos poderes en el orden inverso de su aparición en la historia, o mirando retrospectivamente desde sus días. Dragón. Ver com. Ap 12:3. Le dio su poder. El dragón representa en primer lugar a Satanás, y en un sentido secundario recibió del dragón “su poder, y su trono, y grande autoridad” fue, claramente, la Roma papal. “De las ruinas de la Roma política se levantó el gran imperio moral en la “forma gigantesca” de la Iglesia Romana” (A. C. Flick, The Rise of the Mediaeval Church [ 1900], p. 150). Esta identificación es confirmada 832 por las especificaciones enumeradas en los versículos siguientes. Detrás de todo estaba Satanás, que procuraba exterminar a la iglesia. Cuando se dio cuenta que sus esfuerzos para aniquilar a los seguidores de Cristo por medio de la persecución resultaban ineficaces, cambió sus tácticas y se propuso separar de Cristo a la iglesia por medio del establecimiento de un sistema religioso falso y complejo. El dragón no actúa directamente por medio del paganismo, sino que empieza a trabajar tras la fachada de una organización profesamente cristiana, esperando de este modo disfrazar su identidad. Trono. Gr. thrónos. Los papas ascendieron al trono de los césares. La capital del sistema papal era la misma que la que había ocupado el Imperio Romano durante su apogeo. Grande autoridad. El papado predominó en los asuntos políticos y religiosos, y sobre la conciencia de los hombres. ]\n\n[V.4-> Adoraron al dragón satanás . Adorar a la bestia papado Vaticano es en verdad adorar al dragón, porque la bestia es el instrumento o agente visible del dragón, que lleva a cabo los propósitos del dragón. El período del restablecimiento del papado también se caracterizará por la actividad sin paralelo del espiritismo. Detrás del espiritismo está Satanás que obra “con todo engaño de iniquidad” (2Ts 2:10). Por medio del catolicismo romano, el espiritismo y el protestantismo apóstata, Satanás se propone lograr que todo el mundo le adore; y lo conseguirá, excepto de un noble remanente que se negará a acceder a sus pretensiones (Ap 12:17; Ap 13:8). Adoraron a la bestia. Ver com. “adoraron al dragón”. ¿Quién como? Tal vez sea una parodia de expresiones similares dirigidas a Dios (Exo 15:11; Sal 35:10; Sal 113:4). ¿Podrá luchar contra ella? La resistencia a las demandas de la bestia evidentemente significaba guerra. Se sugiere que regiría por la fuerza de las armas y que la resistencia sería inútil; pero finalmente Cristo y los ejércitos del cielo tendrán éxito en su lucha contra ella, y la arrojarán viva “dentro de un lago de fuego que arde con azufre” (Ap 19:20). ]\n\nApocalipsis (de Juan) 13-> Ver.\n\n[V.5-> Grandes cosas. En cuanto a ejemplos de las jactanciosas pretensiones del papado, ver com. Dan 7:25. Las especificaciones de Ap 13:5-7 claramente identifican al poder simbolizado por la bestia con el que fue representado por el cuerno pequeño de la cuarta bestia de Dan. 7. Entre los paralelos pueden notarse los siguientes: (1) la bestia de Apoc. 13 tenía una “boca que hablaba grandes cosas y blasfemias” Santo sumopontifice vicario de Cristo Santo padre (ver. 5), el cuerno pequeño de Dan. 7 también tenía una “boca que hablaba grandes cosas” (Ap 13:8); (2) la bestia actuaría durante “cuarenta y dos meses” (Ap 13:5; ver com. Ap 12:6), el cuerno continuaría “hasta tiempo, y tiempos, y medio tiempo” (ver com. Dan 7:25); (3) la bestia haría “guerra contra los santos” y los vencería (Ap 13:7), el cuerno “hacía guerra contra los santos, y los vencía” (Dan 7:21). Blasfemias. Ver com. Ap 13:1; cf. Ap 13:6, donde se describen con más detalles estas blasfemias. Hchuar. Gr. poieō, “hacer”, “ejecutar”, “realizar”. Cuarenta y dos meses. Ver com. Ap 12:6; cf. Ap 11:2...']"

Si bien es cierto que el co2 atmosférico es esencial para la vida de las especies vegetales, es evidente que el uso de combustibles fósiles ha hecho que la atmosfera aumente la cantidad de dióxido de carbono en estado gaseoso. Tomando en cuenta que las especies vegetales absorben co2, seria necesario promover el cultivo de plantas y arboles. Las que se deberían de renovar, es decir, un árbol no necesariamente absorbe Co2 y emite O2, todo depende del estado en el que se encuentre. Una semilla de árbol recién plantada sí absorbe co2, un árbol en crecimiento sí absorbe co2, un árbol maduro absorbe y emite co2 (balance neutro), un árbol que termino su periodo de vida emite co2, la misma cantidad que absorbió a lo largo de su vida y dependiendo del estado de descomposición en el que se encuentre lo hará en pocos años o relativamente mucho tiempo. Es en este punto donde se debe de tomar atención, lo mas aconsejable es renovar bosques, se debería de cultivar un bosque hasta que alcance su máximo nivel de retención de co2, después de lo cual se debería renovar el bosque, plantándolo nuevamente desde un inicio, de esta forma se tendría un balance negativo de co2.

Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l\'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d\'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the ""Grenoble analytical setup,"" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

Firstly, I'm curious about the target customer base for such a large appliance. Considering that most doors are likely too narrow to accommodate it, I'm wondering who would actually purchase it. Even in my modern house, which has extra wide doors for my wheelchair-bound wife, the appliance might still be too wide by just a few millimeters. Additionally, I have concerns about the assembly process. What if the printer proves to be difficult to assemble? Even if I manage to assemble it successfully, there's still the possibility of errors that could impact the printing process. Furthermore, the sheer size of the printer might pose a challenge when assembling it alone.\n\nThe price is also a cause for concern. I sincerely hope that it isn't another cheap printer that turns out to be useless. All I want is the ability to print without having to spend hours on conversion work or invest a considerable amount of money upfront.\n\nLastly, there's the matter of speed. Based on what I've observed so far, the prints I've seen have been relatively small. This raises doubts about whether the printer can truly match its claimed speed. If it takes as long as the Prusa XL, prints could potentially take weeks.

I just wanted to leave this comment on a machine you reviewed and talked about it in your video and I think that people should know this about this company before they buy this product.\nI tried to purchase the Anycubic photon Mono M5s and I found out that the discounts and offers they have on their website are all fake. The company is not an American company (which is ok) and is not located in US either. It is in Hong Kong but yet they charge Tax (LOL) even much higher rate than Uncle Sam does. They pocket the tax. They charge a lot for shipping as well. They offered a coupon of $60 worth for $10 and they don’t give you the access to use it until a few days later. Actually later after they charge you, they give you the restrictions. They didn’t let me use the coupon on the machine while they have special on it and said that is not available for this machine. 3 days later and they said you can only use it on this machine and only after the price has gone up. They raised the price of the machine $100 and now they say that I can use this coupon. Every email I sent them they didn’t respond right away and when they did they didn’t answer any of my questions and only send me a message about how I should buy the machine as soon as possible. I will not trust this company and buy any expensive machines if they are not responding to any concerns or question. Basically their warranty doesn’t mean anything either.', 'My experience with this printer and this company is a LOT different. I purchased 2 of these after seeing reviews like this one, purchased from Anycubic, and BOTH were defective. Both had the exact same issue, a bad bearing in the motor. The problem on one of them showed right away, and after contacting Anycubic they decided to cover their so called warranty by shipping me a motor in a plastic bag. Thats right, a plastic bag. Of course it arrived damaged, having been bent in shipping. Instead of replacing wither the motor or the machine, they claimed to me that they no longer had any of them and I should return it for the refund. I returned it, then after 15 days I had to file a claim with my bank to get my refund. All this time, they did still have them in stock, they had just raised the price by another $150. The second one, with the exact same issue, is still sitting here nonfunctional because Anycubic is dragging things out. The last email I got from them, which was their reply to my asking what is going on with the motor they were supposed to be sending me was for them to start all over again like it was the first time I contacted them. I have been going back and forth with this company for weeks over this issue. And this is not a clear ""oh the motor isn\'t running"" type of issue. It was so subtle that while I never managed to get a successful print on this machine (I was always thinking I was doing something wrong at first) which I ended up wasting over $150 resin with failed print after failed print. But, hey, I guess they just think someone like me is not only made of money but also someone who doesn\'t need a warranty. I would advise anyone wanting a resin 3D printer to get one from ANY other company out there. Anycubic has proven to me that they not only make shoddy products, they don\'t care about the customers. All they want is to see how many people they can trick into purchasing an expensive machine and then they will drag things out or wash their hands of you, leaving you with no other choice but to file charges and report them to the FTC. Companies like this one should not be allowed to do business here in the U.S. if this is how they are going to act.

The entire screen develops an exposure gradient with less exposure near the center.  The steepness of the gradient increases with time until it will not print near the center of the screen.\n\nI just returned two Elegoo Saturn (original version) resin printers because in both, exposure seemed weak at the center of the screen while they printed OK near the edges.  Rafts would be noticeably thinner, supports missing, features of parts, or entire parts missing around the center of the screen.  Increasing exposure helped briefly but greatly accelerated the degradation.  When I reached 5 sec layer exposures (after increasing gradually from 2.5), I decided this was failing and returned them both to Amazon.  By that point, three out of five models on the build plate would fail (despite the doubled exposure time) and resin waste was another reason for returning the printers.\n\nI mention it here because my issues seem to be LCD-related, and I did a couple of online searches that did not return any information about this issue of resin not wanting to cure near the center of the screen and the problem getting worse over time.  I can't be the only one who has seen this issue, especially since two machines have done this.  \n\nDoes anyone have any information about why this happens?

The other is these screens are made fairly cheaply, and you get what you pay for. If you wanted a printer that would last a long time and live up to industrial standards, you'd pay industrial prices. I'm talking like 50-100k (US). If you get good prints from your printer, and you can make enough money to pay it off (or save enough time printing to justify buying the printer), consider it a good investment and buy a new screen.... Hopefully the technology will improve a bit in the near future.\n\nOne thing I have seen recently from printers: Instead of using color LCD screens and just using one color, they are making screens that are only one color of uv light. This can help the cost and increase the strength. Remember too, MSLA is a relatively new process. I think the first commercial version came out 3-5 years ago...""]"

Since i was waiting today for my new ender 3 hotend to come in the mail, i figured to give it another shot. By now google actually came up with an answer for another(newer) model saying that the z axis sensor might be broken and can be disconnected for testing and replaced if faulty. The sensor on this machine looks different and is located on a different position but indeed disconnecting allowed the z axis to come down. I noticed that this seems to be a photo-led switch, and i guess the three pins on the connector are VCC, gnd and data with data only being high if the bed doesn't obstruct the view of the photo-led and low if the bed is in between. I noticed wiggling the led turned it off, and after that auto leveling worked. The first print with the original resin that had been in the printer for over a year was actually quite good, even though the sensor started malfunctioning again. I believe the issue is a bad solder joint for the photo-led, so i will take it out on Tuesday and check that further.

One file for each game in the orange box. These cfg's contain a list of the bind source command. This command binds all the buttons to their corresponding actions in-game.

However, to produce that input power, we need to consume several times more power  due to the low effciency of many systems.

Antidepressants actually increase the risk of SUICIDAL AND HOMICIDAL IDEATION in people of all ages (not just young adults), they are linked to worst long term outcomes compared to those who do not take antidepressants for their anxiety and depression. The chemical imbalance theory is not true but rather a marketing ploy by big pharma. Antidepressants also all need to be slowly tapered and can cause debilitating withdrawal symptoms that can lasts for years in some cases if someone doesn\'t taper safely. The issue would be to try to find the root cause of your symptoms. If not caused by trauma then anxiety and depression are thought to be symptoms of something physically going on in the body. It could be nutritional deficiencies or allergies, hormonal imbalances such as Thyroid disease or vitamin D or other vitamin deficiencies, heavy metal or chemical toxins, Lyme disease, genetic defects such as the MTHFR gene variations, histamine intolerance, previous medication toxicity, bad gut health, brain trauma, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, unbalanced blood sugar levels and more.\n\n\nIf you can find a functional or integrative doctor then they can do the testing to find the root cause of your symptoms. Antidepressants only mask symptoms and damage a person\'s health while they do not realize it. Any part of the brain and body can be affected so many doctors do not tie health problems with the antidepressant. Most Psychiatrist\'s, Doctor\'s and Pharmacists are clueless about tapering off and follow old tapering guidelines by Big Pharma.\n\nThey also lack with informed consent about debilitating withdrawals, health conditions caused by SSRIs.

People who have closer approximations or similar values can be reasoned with. However, most people are given a set of values from their culture.

2902,LezaPdrrtFo,"[""It's becoming clear that with all the brain and consciousness theories out there, the proof will be in the pudding. By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with primary consciousness will probably have to come first.\r\n\r\nWhat I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.  They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.  The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way.  No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.\r\n\r\n I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter,  the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory.  I believe the extended TNGS  is that theory.  My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public.  And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.\r\n\r\nMy advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly. Dr. Edelman's roadmap to a conscious machine is at https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461"", '🙂👏', 'First.❤']"

This wondrous being gives us lessons in worship, and what lessons?  The frog hardly stops remembering and praising God Almighty, because it is a “thing”, and everything glorifies God’s praises.\n\n Frogs were mentioned in the Holy Qur’an in verse: 133 of Surat Al-A’raf, the Almighty said, informing our master Muhammad - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - about the worldly torment that Pharaoh and his people were subjected to:  )).\n\n And if we try to identify this wondrous creature, we may know it from some of its wonders, including that it is a terrestrial aquatic animal that lives on land and lives in water.  It is submerged in water, and it has teeth in the upper jaw only that help it to press on its prey.\n\n It has no teeth in the lower jaw because it does not chew its prey, but rather swallows it. It has a long tongue hanging at the front of the mouth that it throws at high speed to catch its prey. It has long hind legs that help it jump quickly to long distances. It also has soft and always moist skin. Among the characteristics of frogs are also that  Females lay eggs from 1,000 to 9,000 eggs, depending on type and sex, and frogs live from five to fifteen years or more, depending on sex and type.\n\n God Almighty created frogs with leather feet that help them to swim, and the sounds that they emit are called chirping, and they are issued by males only without females, and frogs are one of the nine signs that God Almighty sent to Pharaoh and his people, so their lives were disturbed as it occupied every inch of their homes, so it filled their mattresses and containers with their food and drink.  So one of them was covered by frogs from his feet to his head, and if one of them opened his mouth, the frog jumped to him and settled in him ((Thus is the seizure of your Lord when He seizes the villages while they are unjust. Indeed, His seizure is painful and severe)).\n\n Frogs are the most glorified animals. It was mentioned in the hadith of Abu Hurairah - may God Almighty be pleased with him - that the Messenger of God (peace and blessings of God be upon him) forbade killing the frog, the ant and the hoopoe, as they predict earthquakes before they occur: years ago, the Chinese city of Sichuan witnessed the most violent earthquake in its history.  More than 100,000 people were killed in the contemporary era, and hundreds of thousands of people were displaced.\n\n The inhabitants of this region noticed that the frogs that were in this afflicted place had abandoned it two days before the earthquake occurred, and gathered in a safe place, and since then, scientists have been working in their laboratories on studies to discover this secret that God Almighty deposited in frogs to benefit from them in predicting earthquakes before they occur.  Glory be to He who entrusted His secret to the weakest of His creation ((This is God's creation, so show me what those besides Him created)).\n\n Frogs compete with humans in the remembrance of God Almighty. Sufyan said: It is said ((There is nothing more remembrance of God Almighty than a frog))  God Almighty, so God Almighty rewarded them with the coolness of the water, and made their croaking of glorification.\n\n And in the book of Al-Zahir by Abi Abdullah Al-Qurtubi that our master David - peace be upon him - said: ((I will glorify God as much as any of his creatures glorified Him)), so a frog called him from a stream in his house: ((O David, you boast before God Almighty with your praise, and that I have  For seventy years my tongue has not dried up from the remembrance of God, Glory be to Him, and for ten nights I have neither eaten green nor drank water preoccupied with two words)) He said what are they?  She said: ((Oh, praise be to every tongue, and mentioned in every place)), So our master David said to himself :((And what may I say more eloquent than this?).\n\n And yet, this is the frog, a sign of God's signs glorifying His praise, and submitting to His command, so what do we humans think of the remembrance of God from among the heedless?

If talk about phenomenological experience then there is no separation - there is just unity of experience which different discernible qualities which do exist independently but in relationship. The idea of a reality ‘out there’ is itself a mental concept, a useful but limited model of what we experience. The early Buddhist texts use quite specific terms for describing experience, in terms of khandas or aggregates of experience. The purpose of such a model is specifically for solving the problem of suffering/ happiness which is central to human experience.  The idea that there are no objects out there, like atomic particles, but simply relationships between events is actually pertinent to the Buddhist project as it applies to the problem of suffering (dukkha). Here the relationship is framed in terms of suffering, cause, cessation and method, which is known as the four noble truths. It is also expressed in the process of dependent causation, which is a description of the causal relationships between the components or activities of experience. The most basic level can split into form or materiality and name which includes: feeling tone, perceptions, mental fabrications (thoughts etc) and consciousness. These are all activities which are directly experienced - there is no doubt about the reality of these aspects of experience. But they can’t be really considered to have a separate reality or  be things out there just like atomic particles - there is only the relationships between these activities of experience. This kind of model is central in a Buddhism for solving the problem dukkha or pain. The relevance for physics is probably not very useful but it is interesting to hear the discussion moving to relationships between qualities rather than the idea of a ultimate reality out there.', '- is not truth just lie \n- hi do not known made true art and made something to earn money \n- to catch stupidity and living from\n_\nit doing humans since world exist\n_\ntrue art you can only made copy but repeat is impossible\n_\nif the child from some 7 years can not recognize beauty is not art is kitsch']"

Great questions and answers, and as always, Lord Martin is an inspiring and effective science communicator :-)', ""Dark matter and dark energy cannot be measured directly.  But the motion of visible matter can be measured.  If general relativity were correct there would be no such thing as these invisible forces.  The only reason why the terms were introduced is because general relativity failed to explain the motion of an estimated 95% of all the matter in the universe.  That's 24% of all the dwarf galaxies and stars and 71.6% of all the galaxies moving away from each other.  So they said there must be 94.6% more things in the universe that are missing, causing the motion to all the visible matter in the universe.  Not that there is anything truly missing in the universe only general relativity is unable to explain it.  They are bullheaded insisting that general relativity is right even though it is unable to explain the motion of about 94.6% of all the visible matter in the universe.  In reality the percentage is pushing it.  The real number is around 99.86%.  Then instead of saying general relativity is wrong by 94.6% they say there is missing energy and missing matter.  Because in order for the equations of general relativity to match observations lots of mass and energy have to be added to the equations, around 99.89% to be precise.  Simply put, if general relativity was right they wouldn't have to rely on things they can't prove.  \n\nI worked as a professional 3D CAD architect using relative and polar Cartesian coordinates for input, (x,y,z)°.  I understand Einstein's equations describing warped spacetime, (x,y,z,t).  Try to create a landscape mesh that accurately represents a 100 acre parcel of land.  It's about the same thing.  Take points in 3D space and connect lines, arcs, and curves along elv marks.  It reveals the contours of the land.  The same exact thing can be done to map out mass and the strength of gravity between other mass.  It's actually easier mapping points between 2 spheres than it is to map out 100 acres of hills, valleys and a creek.  Anyways, I was able to figure out the missing variables causing the accelerated rotational curve with the galactic disk pinned on dark matter.  I just published 2 books a few days ago called DARK MATTER: What's Wrong With General Relativity? by Ron Kemp in both hardcover and paperback versions. It's only $12.25 USD.

Are we assuming some kind of cultural and individual isolation between the two groups (Florida and the one from the Caribbean)? If yes, how much do we really know about the interactions between the groups (and any others)?\n\nMy doubt is accented, when i note that this conclusion is so similar to the ones that we made on the old days about the different human culture and how we assumed that they were much more isolated from each other than we think modernly.\n\nSimplicity and linearity in the theories are of great help to create some early models, but one should use some common sense when ""cutting"" the complex. It is much more strange to believe in ""pure"" isolated groups than in ""limited"" intermixing ones. Isolation looks like a forced proposition. I think that some degree of shared culture is more simple to assume. Are we creating a model too artificial to be of real use?\nAm i already so far from the video content? It is at theses times that more detailed info, about what ones is talking about, is so important :)\n\nContinuing the rant, how many probable ""dolphins stories"" can be easily discover where there is no such isolation? Let us filter the more realistic ones and begin to create a statistical space...\n\nGoing further, here are some invented meta-stories about the dolphins as groups (not individual dolphins).\nPeople say that they are complex and intelligent creatures. Do they have culture, economy (trading, sharing, ...), etc? Do they have clear social statuses? It seems that i heard somewhere that they have language. Probably it has differences between genealogies and relevantly spatially separated regions. And so much more.\nIf they have any kind of culture, they also must have some type of ""memes"" and cultural semantics.\n\nAll of these nothing more than fantasy speculations, but some of them (in some degree) might have some relevance to the real dolphins and the isolationist idea.\nThis rant is to illustrate my doubts about such conclusion.\n\nThanks for the video.', 'Morphogenetic fields??', 'Animal culture right there.']"

The data has been questionably altered to correlate to co2. Though I do not dispute some warming along with a cooling trend over a c. 30 year period up to the late 70s as CO2 was rising (correlation and causation ???) Anthropogenic contribution to warming has clearly occurred but the over exaggerated position and reporting of the IPCC does little to impress or convince many scientists with their own mind and no reliance on funding associated with climate research.\n\nI can not understand why any properly educated scientist would align to a notional concept that preindustrial co2 concentrations are the desired target and proper level.  Geology tells us that as life exploded onto planet earth some 500 million years ago during the Cambrian CO2 was between 5000 and 7000 ppm.  Natural sequestration since has locked away this co2 into rock and buried it to the extent that as we exited the last glacial maxima 21,000 years ago co2 was 180ppm just 30ppm from the extinction threshold of all life on earth as C3 photosynthesis starts to shut down (85% of all photosynthesis). PreIndustrial is not a concept any proper scientist could rationalise and align to.  The question is what is the correct CO2 level for life on this orb?  The mechanics of C3 photosynthesis indicates between 800 and 1200 ppm if you believe and trust in evolution.  PreIndustrial 280ppm has no place in the objective and rational mind of a scientist.

So, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Therefore, invisible AND visible SPACE in FUNDAMENTAL equilibrium AND balance IS the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of space consistent WITH/AS what is fundamentally balanced GRAVITATIONAL/ELECTROMAGNETIC force/energy; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Accordingly, inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is proportional to (or balanced with/as) GRAVITATIONAL force/energy; as this balances AND unifies ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy AND gravity; as this balances gravity AND inertia.

Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND balanced IN AND OUT of SPACE AND TIME, as gravity is electromagnetism/energy. E=mc2 IS F=ma. This is entirely proven by the mathematical unification of Maxwell\'s equations AND Einstein\'s equations (given the addition of a fourth spatial dimension). Indeed, this explains why Einstein\'s equations predict that SPACE is either expanding or contracting. Moreover, this is why Einstein\'s equations allow for (or predict) ""black holes"". Balance and completeness go hand in hand. Einstein\'s equations are NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL. Notice the term c4. GREAT !!! ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This is proven by F=ma AND E=mc2. I have provided top down, true, and overwhelming mathematical proof AS WELL that gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. So, It is now abundantly and quite clear that Einstein never nearly understood gravity AND physics/physical experience. (Obviously, E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma.) Sir Isaac Newton now ranks second.\n\nVery importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.\n\nIn fact, the ROTATION of the moon does MATCH it\'s REVOLUTION.

So, ""mass""/energy involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance consistent WITH what is BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL force/energy; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

In this case we trapped a pair of rhenium (Re) atoms bonded together to form Re2,"" study author Andrei Khlobystov, professor of chemistry at the University of Nottingham, said in a news release. ""Because rhenium has a high atomic number it is easier to see in TEM than lighter elements, allowing us to identify each metal atom as a dark dot.""\n\nScientists have previously used electron beams to simultaneously image and incite atomic activity -- to both catalyze and record chemical reactions. The method is known as transmission electron microscopy, and for the latest research, scientists used the technique to watch Re2 bond with carbon nanotubes.\n\n""As we imaged these diatomic molecules by the state of the art chromatic and spherical aberration corrected SALVE TEM, we observed the atomic-scale dynamics of Re2 adsorbed on the graphitic lattice of the nanotube and discovered that the bond length changes in Re2 in a series of discrete steps,"" said Ute Kaiser, professor at Ulm University in Germany.\n\nThe imaging experiments showcased a pair of Re2 atoms walking across the surface of the nanotubes.\n""It was surprisingly clear how the two atoms move in pairs, clearly indicating a bond between them. Importantly, as Re2 moves down the nanotube, the bond length changes, indicating that the bond becomes stronger or weaker depending on the environment around the atoms,"" said Ulm University researcher Kecheng Cao.\nThe recordings of the movements of the two atoms revealed a series of vibrations as their bond was stretched apart. When the bond ultimately broke, the vibrations ceased. These observations of bond making and breaking could help scientists better understand the magnetic, electronic and catalytic properties of materials.\n\n""To our knowledge, this is the first time when bond evolution, breaking and formation was recorded on film at the atomic scale. Electron microscopy is already becoming an analytical tool for determining structures of molecules,"" said Khlobystov.

At one point in that discussion, they talked about a scene from Carl Sagan\'s novel\xa0Contact\xa0in which the protagonist, Ellie, finds in the expansion of pi what she calls a signature, perhaps of God. I emailed Peter about this discussion, and I\'m sharing some of what I had to say here, as it is related to my own upcoming publication,\xa0Dot, Dot, Dot, about infinity and God, currently in the final stages of preparation.\n\n\n\nIn very brief, the fictional ""signature"" referred to in\xa0Contact\xa0is effectively a very long string of 1s and 0s far out (after some 10^20 seemingly random numbers) in the base-11 expansion of pi that when arranged in a square of a specific size yields a clear drawing of a circle with diameter. The question that Dawkins and Boghossian discussed briefly is whether or not such a thing could be identified as a ""signature of God."" That is, they discussed what, if anything, it might mean. From my perspective as a mathematician, I immediately thought that what it would mean is ""not much.""\xa0\n\n\n\nMy thinking that I sent to Peter went like this: Riding on a rather significant conditional,\xa0if\xa0the ""digits"" of pi (in any base), are truly random, it\'s guaranteed that the so-called ""signature of God"" from\xa0Contact\xa0will occur at some point in the string of numbers–along with anything and everything else that could be rendered that way. It is not known, though, and may not be the case that the digits of pi are truly random. It is my opinion that finding such a thing somewhere in the decimal expansion of pi would not be surprising on its own.\n\n\n\nPeter wrote back and asked a great question that serves as the impetus of this blog post. He asked: ""What if the \'signature\' in pi repeated itself only once? Would that be evidence?"" The remainder here is adapted from my response.\n\n\n\nI wrote:\n\nThat\'s likely to be unknowable.\xa0\nThere are two ways to guarantee that such a ""signature"" is there. The first is obvious: observe it somewhere. As I said, given that we ever look far enough and get the parameters right, I wouldn\'t actually be surprised to find out that it is there somewhere, so this could definitely be done, at least conceptually. It wouldn\'t prove anything, though–not anything to do with God and not anything assuring it is there only once.\n\nRead more …\nWritten By: RDFRS\ncontinue to source article at youtube.com', 'Hardcore Absolute Fact:  20 - 40 Billion Dollars should first be spend to alleviate suffrage: homelessness and poverty!!!!!!!

At one point in that discussion, they talked about a scene from Carl Sagan\'s novel\xa0Contact\xa0in which the protagonist, Ellie, finds in the expansion of pi what she calls a signature, perhaps of God. I emailed Peter about this discussion, and I\'m sharing some of what I had to say here, as it is related to my own upcoming publication,\xa0Dot, Dot, Dot, about infinity and God, currently in the final stages of preparation.\n\n\n\nIn very brief, the fictional ""signature"" referred to in\xa0Contact\xa0is effectively a very long string of 1s and 0s far out (after some 10^20 seemingly random numbers) in the base-11 expansion of pi that when arranged in a square of a specific size yields a clear drawing of a circle with diameter. The question that Dawkins and Boghossian discussed briefly is whether or not such a thing could be identified as a ""signature of God."" That is, they discussed what, if anything, it might mean. From my perspective as a mathematician, I immediately thought that what it would mean is ""not much.""\xa0\n\n\n\nMy thinking that I sent to Peter went like this: Riding on a rather significant conditional,\xa0if\xa0the ""digits"" of pi (in any base), are truly random, it\'s guaranteed that the so-called ""signature of God"" from\xa0Contact\xa0will occur at some point in the string of numbers–along with anything and everything else that could be rendered that way. It is not known, though, and may not be the case that the digits of pi are truly random. It is my opinion that finding such a thing somewhere in the decimal expansion of pi would not be surprising on its own.\n\n\n\nPeter wrote back and asked a great question that serves as the impetus of this blog post. He asked: ""What if the \'signature\' in pi repeated itself only once? Would that be evidence?"" The remainder here is adapted from my response.\n\n\n\nI wrote:\n\nThat\'s likely to be unknowable.\xa0\nThere are two ways to guarantee that such a ""signature"" is there. The first is obvious: observe it somewhere. As I said, given that we ever look far enough and get the parameters right, I wouldn\'t actually be surprised to find out that it is there somewhere, so this could definitely be done, at least conceptually. It wouldn\'t prove anything, though–not anything to do with God and not anything assuring it is there only once.\n\nRead more …\nWritten By: RDFRS\ncontinue to source article at youtube.com', 'Your brains have a mechanism for making AI.

One just needs the interest and commitment to absorb information on a particular topic and as he does, he will acquire general learning techniques such as objectivity, first principles, and the scientific method along the way.

This flooding took out the emergency fire pump diesel engine that the Chief convinced the Surveyor he would fix asap so the vessel was given a dispensation to sail.  In my time on board we had numerous small fires, a pump room fire that used the entire stock of CO2 fire fighting media -   the ship discharged oil cargo with a faulty inert gas system and on that cargo operation - a fire caused by welding in the engine room - and the emergency fire pump diesel was never repaired while I was on board.   I went on to spend 40 more years in oil tankers from 35,000 tons to 440,000 tons and now I am retired, I realise how lucky I was.

In every crash either involving a train , ship, plane or truck there is always multiple possiblities as to what happened but the main thing is always human error. Like Kerry said the law is not hard to understand. When you see any kind of emergency vehicle from the most dangerous like police or fire to less dangerous like towing with their lights flashing you're supposed to do 3 things. Slow down and wait for the emergency vehicle to pass, move into another lane if you have room or stop and be patient until the emergency vehicle either leaves or clears traffic. When I watch these shows like highway thru hell and heavy rescue 401 it just surprises me how little people care about the laws of traffic and how less they respect or appreciate the first responders that are out here day in and day out to keep the roads safe. How they constantly have to watch their backs while trying to focus on the job at hand. I wonder if Kerry ever had an experience out on those roads. Another funny thing is how when the weather turns from nice to ugly people still drive as if they can make it through and end up in a nasty collision. What amazes me more than people breaking the law trying to get to where they want to go is how these crashes appear once they've happened and the drivers still walk away with minor or no injuries at all. These trucks must be well built. But the law doesn't just apply to 1st responder vehicles. There's also buses on their way to school. When you see a school stopped on the side of the road with the stop sign out and it's own lights flashing you're supposed to stop because their either picking up a kid or dropping them off and they may live across from where the bus has stopped. The law is very specific, it's not rocket science. I applaud them for going out there despite of those who disrespect their flashing lights as if they have the right away.

5569,2l9iXgfwS0c,"['I am sure most of you have not read Hawking’s last paper “A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation [Expanding Universe]? I have twice and he not only thinks the universe is the product of a hologram but by doing so he had negated his entire work on black holes at the center of Quasars/Galaxies. I can understand why he had it published posthumously. Over the years he had modified his theories on black holes to eventually stating that as they lose energy over time and eventually disappear. If they do disappear then one certainly does not exist at the center of our galaxy. What he is implying in this article is, what I have been saying and proving over the last 41-years, the Universe is the product of information (The Theory of Multidimensional Reality) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8OsDwPaBzM&t=14s]. \n      To explain what he is saying in brief is not easy but here it is. When he writes “eternal inflation” he means the expansion of the universe and entropy. One of the problems in astrophysics is that the universe is expanding but the temperature is not going down as they theorize. That is because they do not know that there is a 12,068-year clock cycle that pumps energy back into the system in the form of all stars nova at the same time—which I proved (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCrczGaUv0Y). Hawking came up with another solution to the problem. He tried to prove that the universe is a hologram, “following proposal for a holographic form, (pg.3)” “resulting two-dimensional holographic measure. (pg.10).” He also stated that the information for the hologram originates in the first dimension “the source has dimension one [1st dimension], to its critical fixed point with a source of dimension two (pg.8).” I was the only scientist who defined dimensions like this. It was explained in my first philosophy-science book “Reality Revealed the Theory of Multidimensional Reality” (1978) and “God’s Day of Judgment” (2007).\n      This is how he indirectly negated all of his work on black holes. He and I both agree that the universe is a type of hologram. However, for any hologram the information for it has to originate in a computer that generates the hologram, hence the first dimension. The transmission dimension is the 2nd dimension. This is why black holes (infinite gravity) cannot exist in our reality. The computer (“the Diehold”) that creates our reality cannot permit an infinite gravity (information) in any point in time and space because it cannot physically do it without making the whole system unstable. There are other important reasons but that is in the books and videos. Stephen Hawking in essence gave me a parting gift. Thank you Stephen, wherever you may be. I hope to see you again, but next time, try to remember there is a God.', '🌏❌🚀🌚💣']"

Eu encontrei um comentário no Youtube e a pessoa testemunhou como ela foi curada de herpes e HPV depois de usar o medicamento fitoterápico do Dr. wise. Eu rapidamente entrei em contato com o e-mail do Dr. e expliquei meu problema para ele e ele preparou as ervas e as enviou para mim através do correio e me deu instruções sobre como usá-las e me disse para ir para um checkup após o uso, o que fiz após duas semanas de fitoterapia e meu resultado foi NEGATIVO. Esperei mais um mês e retestei o resultado, ainda era NEGATIVO e meu médico me disse que estou completamente livre de herpes. Estou muito feliz e grato ao Dr. wise pelo que ele fez por mim e continuarei a compartilhar isso para que as pessoas saibam que existe cura para o herpes.

Como el chileno es ingrato, nos fuimos acostumbrando a estar mejor y fuimos cediendo espacio a los comunistas, hemos permitido que encarcelen a nuestros valientes soldados, que mueran en prisión. El general dejó un sistema espectacular de pensiones, pero en democracia los presidentes fueron cediendo nuestros derechos a las afp y el cotizante perdiera beneficios con los años. Obvio que en 17 años se cometieron errores, después de todo Boric también los ha cometido, seguramente alguien dirá ""Boric no ha matado a nadie"" y acaso permitir dejar entrar a todos los delincuentes de America no es un crimen de lesa humanidad? Dejar que en Chile se instalen los narcos más peligrosos no es un crimen? Permitir que una parte del país sea dominada por bandas delictuales y sea entregada al pillaje no es un crimen? Lástima y hay que ser honestos con nosotros mismos y reconocer con tristeza que ahora no tendremos a ningún general Pinochet que nos salve y seguramente nos merecemos este triste final.
