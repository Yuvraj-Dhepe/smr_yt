I also included references to Lovecraftian lore. The ending will consist of a story arc where the world’s pandoras have gotten prideful and overconfident (essentially the equivalent of macho posturing), and limiters are essentially servants, like pledges in a fraternity. The ringleader is a pandora veteran who believes she is a reincarnation of Ishtar, goddess of lust. As in “she’s completely lost her sanity”. There are creatures like moon beasts and deep ones roaming the highways, and as such all cities are quarantined and all routes out are blocked or destroyed. There is an underground militia opposing the pandora regime. Kazuya has withdrawn from the public eye, posing as a soldier named Victor. Satellizer was one of the regime’s assassins for a short time, until she begins to question the point of her position.

416;MSYkvdptUhs;"['Tragic death but who poisoned him', 'It\'s been 30 years since this brilliant, sensitive being died but they didn\'t reveal the truth about what happened that tragic night. \nMany of you may know that River refused the leading role in the film ""The Crow"" which we all know the plot but very few know that through this film, there was a plot against him: as a matter of fact the story of Eric Draven was sewn around the character of River Phoenix, but no one noticed since the part was played by Brandon Lee, who agreed to take River\'s role. \nRiver refused the part because he knew the intentions of those who had interest in hurting him and he was well aware that some ""strange accident"" could happen to him if he accepted that role. In fact, in the film they would have staged his death: the strange accident, however, did happen to his replacement, Brandon. No need to remember the episode that cost Lee\'s life on the set of the same movie, apparently he too was a target, but that\'s another story... Brandon\'s death also caused great dismay and sorrow.\nIn ""The Crow"", Eric Draven (River), is a band leader, singer and guitar player who is murdered on Halloween night (in the film called devil\'s night). \nBoth Eric Draven and River die on a sidewalk although in different ways. \nBrandon Lee and River Phoenix both died in 1993, both on day 31st (Brandon on March 31st). \nThe crow as bird was used as symbol of death, antagonistic to the Phoenix, which symbolizes rebirth. In fact, the scene of the crow drawn with fire was emblematic.\nWith all these ""coincidences"", it is very difficult to believe that River Phoenix death was his own fault and on Halloween, in fact several witnesses declared that they saw John Frusciante handing River a glass and as River ingested the drink he said: ""what the hell is this?"" The local police said that they had received several reports from witnesses who claimed that John Frusciante had poisoned River but these testimonies were never disclosed in the main sources of informations. \nFrusciante was probably asked to pass River the glass, the question is: Who made the mixture and asked Frusciante to give it to River?\nThe well-known director/actor William Richert who also worked with River in ""my own private Idaho"" has declared (the video can be found on YouTube) that River was killed by a guitar player. William, who has known River for 7 years, firmly stated that River did not use drugs other than smoking a little weed every now and then.\nAfter River\'s death, Leonardo DiCaprio took his place in the film roles that River had signed up for. James Cameron himself said that he carefully created the role of Jack Dawson for no one but River years before the Titanic was made. DiCaprio become good, but nobody could even come close to River\'s talent, everyone would fade beside him. Eyewitnesses declared without any doubt that DiCaprio was\xa0present at the viper room that night.\nI wish they would disclose the true story of what happened to River but I don\'t think they ever will because the hidden power that pulls the strings behind the film industry and the mainstream media want people to think of him as a drug addict and not as a multi-talented activist, who inspired the consciences and hearts of his fans with his altruism towards the planet, animals and human beings, fighting for everyone\'s rights and donating various funds to many causes. It is astounding and inspiring if you think that when he was just a kid, in the midst of financial difficulties, he played his guitar on the streets to make some money so he could help his family.. and he was still very young when he donated funds to humanitarian causes. Money meant nothing to him, he walked around in modest clothing and rubber shoes like converse, he refused to wear leather because he was against the killing of any animal. Among other things, he had purchased several acres in Costa Rica to preserve the planet from deforestation. To this day, I don\'t know another celebrity who had such kindness and sensitivity as River Phoenix, especially at such young age. Similar virtues do not belong to people with the mental problems they said he had, usually people who suffer from those disorders are empty. \nThe system didn\'t want the world to be inspired by River\'s good actions hence they put a label on him so there wouldn\'t be any glory for him. But they were wrong: people all over the world love River very much and they\'re still fondly inspired by his actions and sensitivity even many years after his death.\nJohn Lennon was also an anti-system activist very committed to boycotting the war. Do you think John was really shot by one of his fans? 🤨 C\'mon now.. \nWhen they decide to eliminate a celebrity, you can be sure that there will be accidental overdoses, findings in bathtubs or even fatal injuries caused by unlikely killers... \nA vegan boy like River, who dies like that, it already raises doubts... he may have had a childhood filled up with challenges, but he always had a deep bond and harmony with his family like he said himself in many interviews. \n\nI hope never to see again the image of a beautiful soul like River, stained and torn to pieces by false news passed as official. \nIf people keep watching the documentaries produced by the same TV lobbies that covered up the evidences, they will never discover the real facts. \nFight for the truth, ask yourself questions, inquire and put together as many clues as possible, You\'ll be able to unravel the truth.\nMake the choices of these pioneers count! Remember their courage and pure heart.\nOnly like this we can give the right value to the memory that River left of himself. \nThanks to those who will read', ""We remember you River, Hollywood should make biopic of one it's prodigial son !"", 'River was murdered via lethal drink many people that should be in prison for the murder of river']";;;;;

She and her family shouldn\'t just be used to fill space in the media, or as real-life soap opera.  Her passing should remind us why monarchy is helpful, in general.\n\nSince the 1700s, the British monarchy has been a huge, tangible power for peace in the world.  This achievement should become clear in comparison with the histories of other countries.  In the 19th & 20th centuries the U.S.A, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain and Greece suffered in various ways civil wars, political storms, and dictatorships.  This shows what can go wrong in the absence of a head of state which is above politics, and which opposes illegal dictatorship.  If there are many reasons England, Wales, and Scotland have had no civil war since Culloden in 1746, having a constitutional monarchy to unify all the people is an important reason.  In the UK, \'peace\' in formal speech is ""The King\'s Peace"".\n\nThe monarchy is separate from the organs of government.  It was not prime minister Baldwin\'s fault Edward VIII chose to abdicate, nor is it fair to blame the monarchy for the Amritsar massacre in India, the Black & Tans in Ireland, or any of the mistakes British rule made in the world.  The great value of the monarchy is to provide unity and stability in a way politicians can’t.  Canada & Australia were given self-government under the British crown, and they have avoided secession and civil war (so far).\n\nOf course King Charles III\'s marriage to Diana was a tragic mistake";" likewise over world war, loss of empire, economic failure, or race in the 20th.  There will always be political violence and problems in the world, and billions of people who know or understand nothing of the British monarchy and the stability it brings.

On another they are taking about Australia, he mentions losing his finger during that fight and running to 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms trying to get away from her but on the stand this was where he supposedly beat her, drug her naked through broken glass and raped her with a whiskey bottle. She mentions NONE OF THAT on the recordings, one would think IF all of that would've happened & he mentioned losing a finger, you could say, yea but you beat me, drug me naked through broken glass and raped me with a bottle so I think we should call it even on that don't ya think?""]";;;;;

I know there's a lot of rumors about them drugging the tigers, to make them more docile, but if you've ever been there and/or talked to anyone who's worked there, you'd know that's not true.\nThe tigers have plenty of energy (especially when playing with each other) and I haven't heard of or witnessed any mistreatment (and I volunteered my time there for a couple of months). They are caged, but are rotated around, so they *all* have time to mingle with other tigers (of the same age) and play in the large enclosure, which has a pond and some other stimuli, like toys, tires, etc.\nI think anyone who buys a large cat and/or a wild animal to keep in a cage as a pet is idiotic and is guilty of mistreatment and animal cruelty.

Beside the economic value of the lions, if there is no demand for lions (hunting them) people will no longer keep hunting concessions open therefore having those huge areas of land become cattle farms again. When this happens all the animals will be decrease in number and then you have a DRAMATIC loss in the population of all species not just lions etc. So yes maybe its not the most appealing method of conservation but hunting is KEY to the abundance of African wildlife, there are at the moment countless game breeders which as a result have tripled the biomass and population of many african species, why do you think there was such an increase? because there was demand for the animals for hunters. So bottom line, hunting maybe means some animals get hunted but the areas where people hunt also sustain many more animals reliant on that very land. And there is already significant restrictions on hunting already so stop trying to boycott the industry and destroy the economies of other countries and consequently diminish the population of the very animals you so love."", 'I\'m glad they started destroying the ivory.

These animals have (had) lives! and I know for a fact that Rhinos, are endangered and one species of rhinos was declared extinct because of this kind of hunting. luckily,  there were a couple found in Indonesia. I also know that some hunting is greatly needed. For example, if people stopped hunting, an over population would occur, and because there are so many animal there 2 things could happen(both are bad). either there would be an over population of herbivores or carnivores. If an over population of herbivores occurred,  there would be so many of them over time that they would eat all of the plants their species has been eating over time, then only a few  of them would adapt and   only mabey survive, and the other ones will starve to death, therefor most likely becoming extinct. If there was an over population of carnivores,  they would kill off almost all of the herbivores, therefor resulting in the loss of food for the carnivores. So, I get that hunting is important, but I think if you take an innocent animals life, you should not put it to waste. and if you say it was in self defense,  first of all, you were most likely doing something to agrivate it second of all, if they dedicated anything to you it was  their instinct.  they don't know how to calmly sit down and have a friendly conversation,  they know how to defend themselves by instinct."", 'Hunting for meat is great.

That all depends on how many crops are available for sale at the market. And ""THAT"" depends on how many vermin are raiding the fields. Its not just how much money farmers make.
